# Use the Findx browser extensions

Instead of [changing your default search engine manually](/en/browserplugin/change-searchengine) in the three most popular browsers, you can install a lightweight browser extension, which will update the default search engine automatically. 

## Findx search engine for Firefox
  
  1. Go to the [Mozilla add-on store and search for Findx](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/findx/).  
  2. Click the **Add to Firefox** button.  
  3. Click **Add** to install the add-on. 
  4. Click **OK**.

This official Findx Firefox add-on sets Findx as your default search engine, home page and new tab page. Now you have [changed the default search engine in Firefox](https://www.findx.com) to Findx, and you can search by typing in the address bar and search field.

But it's not enough to just search in private, you should protect your privacy while you are browsing. 

## Findx Privacy Control add-on for Firefox
  
  1. Go to the [Mozilla add-on store and search for Findx Privacy Control](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/findx-privacy-control/).  
  2. Click the **Add to Firefox** button.  
  3. Click **Add** to install the add-on. 
  4. Click **OK**.

Findx Privacy Control icon will be added to Firefox. Use this to control what gets blocked - all ads and trackers, or just the creepy ones.
