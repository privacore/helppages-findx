# Settings

There are many settings that you can change in the Findx Privacy Control browser extension.

Go to the settings and options page:
1. Click on the Findx Privacy Control icon.
2. Click on the gear icon at the top right.

From here you can:

* [manage your protection lists](/en/privacycontrol/manageprotectionlists)
* [build your own custom protection list](/en/privacycontrol/mytrackingfilter)
* [add or remove your own dynamic filtering rules](/en/privacycontrol/dynamicfilteringrules)
* [manage your whitelist](/en/privacycontrol/whitelist)

There are a number of additional settings, as detailed briefly below. 

## Number of requests blocked on the icon

To display a small number on the icon next to the search or URL field in your browser, enable the checkbox next to **Show the number of blocked requests on the icon**.

This is enabled by default.

## Additional privacy settings

* **Link pre-fetching** may speed up page loading times, but it also can pose a privacy risk (disabled by default).
* Some web pages 'ping' their owners or third-parties whenever a page is loaded. By disabling **hyperlink auditing**, this is prevented (disabled by default).
* If you are browsing the web using a VPN, you want the IP address visible to web pages to be that of the VPN, not the one assigned to you by your internet service provider. You want to enable **Prevent WebRTC from leaking local IP addresses** (by default).

## Reset Findx Privacy Control to its default settings

Have you made changes and they are no longer working? Or perhaps you want to customize your privacy settings again from scratch?
