# Getting started

You can use Findx just as you would a normal search engine: Type in your search query and press Enter. 

Findx will search its own index for results. Be aware that because Findx is a new search engine, you may not see as accurate or relevant results as you would on a big search engine. The index is growing every day, so you will see results improve over time. 

Unlike many other search engines, Findx does not track what you search for. It does not track which results you click on. You are searching in private.

This also means that your search results are not ranked based on what you have clicked on or searched for before. 

What you see is what everyone sees - Findx's ranking algorithm is not biased.

## Features of Findx 

There are several features that help you get more out of Findx than simply searching the web in private. 

- [Improve search results](helpimprovesearch): Collaborate with your fellow searchers and contribute your feedback to improve search results for everyone.
- [Shopping search](shopping): Search for gifts in private, without worrying that your intended recipient will see ads related to your search!
- [Private route planning](maps): Keep details of your planned routes to yourself using our private map search feature.
- [Image search](image-index.md): Findx searches popular image services which have quality moderation, so you know the images that you (and your children) see are safe.
- [Video search](video-playback): You can search for videos and browse results in private. To ensure the highest level of privacy, use Findx with our private browser Privafox.
- [Safe search](safesearch): Make sure you protect your children and filter out sites that contain 'adult' content.
