# What is Findx public beta?
Beta means that you will experience Findx while it's being built. The Privacore team knows there is a lot of work to do before we are ready for a final release, but we want to let users follow our progress while we are building the new real internet search engine from Europe.  

## What can I expect from the beta version?
Findx is not fully developed, so you can't yet be sure of finding everything you are looking for, but we are growing the index rapidly. 

### Missing search results
You might be wondering, for example:  

- Why is my website not listed? 
- When I found a particular result on Google, why isn't it on Findx?

Finding results requires the search engine robot to have actually visited a website and added it to the index. As you can imagine, it will take a while before Findxbot visits all of the important sites on the internet. 

### Variation in perfomance and speed  
You may also experience varied performance. This happens because our development team is hard at work and delivering continuous updates.

## Start searching and improving the web in private
The Findx beta lets you search the web in private, and it will not collect your personal behaviour or search history.

### Available services in beta 
All these searches are available to you right now – but of course, they will stay in beta while the Privacore team improves them!  

* Web search
* Map search and route planning
* Shopping search
* Image and video search  
* Instant answers

## Help improve search results 
We believe you know a lot about what is good on the web and what needs improving. That's why you can help other “finders” to get better results, and why you as a user can give feedback directly in the search results.

We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this feature!

## Share your experience  
Other people are becoming increasingly aware of behavioural tracking - it can be hard to know what happens when you are online. If you feel you have lost control, and want to share your opinion or tips or tricks to help others, then [join our online community](https://forum.privacore.com).

 
Please leave us feedback, good or bad, in our online community!
 
 
Happy searching!
