# Web search

Findx is an independent search engine from Europe and a true crawler-based search engine. You can keep your searches private - your search history isn't saved, and the results we display are from our own index and crawler.

Findx is still in an early phase - our index is not yet “complete”. Search results may not be the most comprehensive. We simply haven’t had enough time to crawl everywhere, but our index is growing rapidly!
