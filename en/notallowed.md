# Not allowed to index

Transparency is key to building the findx search engine, and so are relevant results. Our crawlers are trawling the web, collecting web pages in order to create a high quality index. This naturally includes results from well known sites such as Yelp and Quora. 

By default, many of these bigger sites only allow certain companies like Google and Bing to index their pages. We have explicitly requested permission to include their pages on findx, in order to let our users find their sites and subsequently visit them.

Unfortunately some sites will not let us index their pages, although they allow our competitors to do so. 

We will be fully transparent about this, and below we list the sites we have specifically requested permission to spider (because their robots.txt disallows it by default), and their response.

We will manually add the links to the main pages of sites we are not allowed to crawl, with a note telling our users that we have been specifically denied permission to spider the site. Try a search for Yelp or Quora on findx to see how it looks.
