#What is findx closed beta access?
Beta access to findx means that you will experience findx while it's being built. The Privacore team knows there is a lot of work to do before we are ready for a public release, but we want to let users follow our progress while we are building the new real internet search engine from Europe.

##What can I expect as a beta user?

-----
findx is not fully developed, so you can't yet be sure of finding what you are looking for.

###Missing search results
You might be wondering, for example:  

- Why is my website not listed? or 
+ On Google I find this result; why is it not on findx?

Finding results in a search requires the search engine robot to actually visit a website. As you can imagine, it will take a while before findxbot visits all the important sites on the internet. 

###Variation in perfomance and speed  
You may also experience a variation in performance. This happens due to the hard work and continuous updates from the development team - and from time to time findx will even be unavailable.
 
##Start searching and improving the web in private
Findx beta gives you access to search the web in private, and will not collect your personal behaviour or search history.

###Available services in beta 
All these searches are available to you right now – but of course still in beta while the Privacore team improves them!  

* Web search
* Map search and route planning
* Shopping search
* Image and Video search

##Help improve search results 
We believe you know a lot about what is good on the web and what needs improving. That's why you can help other “finders” to get better results, and why you as a user can give feedback directly in the search results.

We are looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this, so keep an eye out because findx will soon be ready for you as a beta user.
 
##Share your experience
Other people are also struggling with behavioural tracking, and it can be hard to know what happens when you are online. If you feel you have lost control and want to share your opinion or tips or tricks then [join the Privacore community – to cultivate online privacy](https://forum.privacore.com).
 
In addition you can give feedback on your experience with findx beta in the forum.
 
Happy searching!
