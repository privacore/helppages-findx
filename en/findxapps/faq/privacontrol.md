# What does Privacontrol do?

Privacontrol allows you to control and prevent online tracking. Malware scripts are blocked by default to prevent you from malicious attempts to collect your personal behavioural data. You decide whether you want to block all tracking scripts on a website, or to allow sites to show acceptable ads.

With Privacontrol in the Findx desktop app you’ll avoid advertisements following you around the web, trying to lure money out of your pocket.
