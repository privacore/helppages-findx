# Getting started

Welcome to the Findx mobile apps! 

You want to protect your privacy online, even when you use your smartphone, and that's exactly what the Findx mobile apps help you to do. The Findx apps don't store your browsing history, they block ads and trackers, and use a private search engine by default. 

We want to help you get the most out of your Findx apps. If you have any questions, or would like some more information about certain features, please [contact us via our online community](https://forum.privacore.com/index.php?p=/categories/findxapps).
