# Help improve search results

Findx lets you suggest improvements and rate each search result. Become a quality rater and help improve the search results not only for yourself, but for all searchers.

Rating results and suggesting improvements is completely optional and a personal choice, and you can do so in private - we do not track you, so we don't know who has rated, suggested changes to, or reported a search result. 

Your feedback will help improve the search experience for everyone.

## Why you should help?
Findx is an independent private search engine, and to to keep serving the most relevant results we need to constantly improve and evolve the software and algorithms behind findx. This will improve private search for everyone over time.

We believe that asking you to contribute is the most natural way to improve the search results. You can easily say whether you like the result, whether it is spam or even malicious, and add details to improve poor or missing descriptions.

## For people with deeper technical understanding
findx is an Open Source project, and you can participate in improving the source code development here on [github](https://github.com/privacore/open-source-search-engine).
