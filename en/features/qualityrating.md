# Quality rating  

We admit that we may not list the results you find most helpful and relevant at the top – at least not during the Findx beta – because we believe search results should not be biased, they should be same for everyone. You can contribute – be a quality rater for Findx and help improve the search results not only for yourself, but for all searchers.
