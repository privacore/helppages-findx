# Image search

## Limited sources in the beta version

Instead of maintaining our own index of images online, and needing to invest in a huge storage facility to host many terabytes of images, Findx anonymously searches legitimate and popular image hosting sites. Right now we are using one source (Shutterstock), but we will be adding more in future.

Go to the "images" tab to search for images with Findx.
