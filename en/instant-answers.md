# Instant Answers


This feature displays an "overview box" to the right of the search results list. When you search for a U.S. state, for example, you’ll see an Instant Answers box containing a description, map, and facts about the state, such as its capital, population, and elected officials. 


To enable Instant Answers:


1. Click the **"triple bar" icon** to open the findx menu.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Next to **Instant Answers**, click the toggle button to slide it to the right. The toggle will become blue, indicating that the feature is active.
4. At the bottom of the page, click **Save and Exit**.

To disable Instant Answers, click the toggle button again to slide it back to the left.
